# EventCalendar
Your team will develop a simple software to manage an event calendar, which is used to schedule the events held at
different campus locations listed below.
HLL114, Hill Center, Busch
ARC103, Allison Road Classroom, Busch
BE_AUD, Beck Hall, Livingston
TIL232, Tillett Hall, Livingston
AB2225, Academic Building, College Avenue
MU302, Murray Hall, College Avenue
The software shall allow the users to book a room for an event or cancel an event on the calendar. The software shall
be able to display the event calendar sorted by event date/time, by campus/building/room, or by the hosting
department. Let’s assume the event calendar only opens to five departments: CS (computer science), EE (electrical
engineering), ITI (information technology and informatics), MATH (mathematics) and BAIT (business analytics and
information technology).
The software is an interactive system where the users enter command lines on the console/terminal, and the system
immediately generates responses and output the results on the console/terminal.

A command; to add an event to the event calendar.

R command, to cancel an event and remove the specified event from the calendar. 

P command, to display the event calendar on the console/terminal, with the current order in the array.

PE command, to display the event calendar on the console/terminal, sorted by the event date and timeslot of the
timeslot. That is, if two events have the same date, display the events in the order of the timeslots.

PC command, to display the event calendar on the console/terminal, sorted by campus and building/room. That
is, if two events are held on the same campus, display the events in the order of building/room number.

PD command, to display the event calendar on the console/terminal, sorted by the department in the contact. If
two events have the same hosting department, the order doesn’t matter.

Q command, to stop the execution of the software.
